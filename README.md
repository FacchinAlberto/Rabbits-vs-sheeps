# Rabbits-vs-sheeps
Bidimensional flow analysis of the rabbits vs sheeps model (dynamical systems for AI)

In this repository I have uploaded a pdf file in which I have analysed the rabbits vs sheeps model.
The main purposes are:
1. find the fixed points
2. calculating the Jacobian matrix and evaluating it in all the fixed points founded in order to be able to classify the points and determine isoclines and manifolds;
3. changing parameters in the bidimensional flow and analyse how it changes based on different variations.

I used the differential equations solver that I made by myself in the final steps of the project, for doing an analysis of the solutions and compare the differences between
Eulero's method, modified Eulero's method and fourth order Runge Kutta.
These three algorithms are usefull to find numerical solutions for differential equations
